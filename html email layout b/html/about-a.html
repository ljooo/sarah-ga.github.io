			<h1>About Us</h1>
			
			<p> At Little Sprouts Early Learning Center we believe that all children are wonderfully unique, each with special gifts and talents.  In order to help nurture your little one's potential, we operate on four core beliefs:
 			</p>

 			<ul>
 				<li>Children learn best through play.  Our little sprouts are given endless opportunities to explore their own interests and choose their own activities from our developmentally appropriate activity centers in each classroom.  
				</li>

				<li>Children learn confidence when they feel loved and supported. Our staff are nurturing and caring, committed to being positive role models for all the children we have been given the opportunity to serve.  
				</li>

				<li>Good nutrition and exercise go hand-in-hand and should be taught together at an early age. Both are vital for the growth and development of healthy children.  </li>

				<li>You are your child's first role model.  We encourage parental involvement at Little Sprouts and look forward to partnering with you to help your child thrive!</li>
 			</ul>

 			<p>Little Sprouts Early Learning Center is licensed annually by the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) Office of Child Care. A copy of the MSDE childcare license is displayed in the lobby. A copy of the State of Maryland Licensing Regulation is available from the director. </p>
