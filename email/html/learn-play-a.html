			<h1>Learn and Play</h1>

			<p> We work hard to stay posted on the most up-to-date teaching methods.  We teach the Houghton Mifflin Curriculm, currently in use in the South Counties Public School System, in our pre-school classrooms.
 			</p>

 			<p> We understand that kids learn by doing, so we provide an endless amount of enthusiasm as well as tools with which to explore.  Our daycare is filled with toys, games, musical instruments, and books.</p>

			<p>Each day, you will receive an evaluation of your child so that you are kept updated on how and what they did that day, how much they ate, and what their mood was like. Communication is very important to us.</p>

			<p>While the methods may vary across age groups, we strive to provide lessons and enrichment in the following areas:</p>

 			<ul>
 				<li>Art</li>
 				<li>Dramatic Play</li>
				<li>Language</li>
				<li>Literature</li>
				<li>Manipulatives</li>
				<li>Music &amp; Movement</li>
				<li>Science</li>
			</ul>
