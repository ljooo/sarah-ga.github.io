What is SublimeText?
    Plain Text editor vs Rich Text editor

What can SublimeText do for us in HTML? 
    1) color-related markup hints
    2) shortcuts & suggestions
    3) connects tags & allows tabbing
    4) preview code in browser
    5) comment out code

HTML vs CSS
    How are they different?
    How are they related?
    What does this have to do with making a sandwich?

Boring stuff (no yawning pls)
    - file management
    - local vs live URLs
    - naming conventions
